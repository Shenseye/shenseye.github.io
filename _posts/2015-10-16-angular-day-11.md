## Day 11 of 100 days with Angular

So after finishing the Official Tutorial from [angularjs.org](http://angularjs.org), i think i have a basic concept and unstanding about AngularJS and now is the time to move on to something more difficult, more interesting. That is what i thought but i'm actually drop one day of the challenge because i'm too busy with doing my fisrt freelancing site and homework. Anyway now i will continue my learning road with [www.ng-newsletter.com](http://www.ng-newsletter.com). That page is full of cool and helpful learning material. The one i will start with is this article [Building the 2048 game in AngularJS](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/building-2048-in-angularjs.html) because i alway thought that Angular is very bad with making Game, so i think this article will change my mind and teach me something new. Because this artical is pretty long and i really don't have much time so i will do a small chunk of this project a day and maybe will drop someday do not post (but still learn :smile:) and summary everything i learned later when i have time. Now i will set up the development structure for the 2048 game in the tutorial.

## Set up development structure

### Install Yeoman and set up the boilerplate:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-angular
mkdir -p ~/Development/2048 && cd ~/Development/2048
yo angular twentyfourtyeight
{% endhighlight%}

Need sleep :sleeping: will update tomorrow
