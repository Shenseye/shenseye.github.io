## Day 7 of 100 days with Angular

To be honest i learned not thing from this lesson. It is exactly the same thing as day 5. The only
new thing is $routeParams service. From what i see i think it act like an object that hold 
parameter as property from the route. Anyway this day i made another toy project from FreeCodeCamp - A
Caculator. I made it using JQuery not Angular because i think using Angular for this simple thing 
is too complicated. I will show it here anyway. And beside that, with this thing done, i only have 
to finish two project to claim my FreeCodeCamp FrontEnd Certificate.
